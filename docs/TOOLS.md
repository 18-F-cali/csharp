## Code Analysis
Code Analysis can be turned on to run after a build of certain projects. This [MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182066.aspx) is a good walkthrough on how to enable code analysis.

**NOTE:** This will add a bit of extra time to compile the project.

Code A uses FxCop to run the analysis. [FxCop](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6544) can be run separately as a stand alone program.

[StyleCop](https://stylecop.codeplex.com/) can be installed and run inside Visual Studio to analyze the code style.
