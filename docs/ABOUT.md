C# is a modern, object oriented language which is developed and maintained by Microsoft.

The syntax of C# is very similar to other languages like Java and C++.

C# is a reasonably popular language, in 2014 it was surveyed that 5% of developers used it.  The learning curve is small, reduced even if the developer has experience with other 'C-Style' languages.

Key Benefits:

- It has a great library with lots of well-documented, easy to use functionality such as writing to a text file, or accessing Windows related features.
- Type Safety
  - Type Safety is a language-agnostic compilation feature that means when code is compiled, types are validated.  This means for example a `string` value could not be assigned to an `int`.
- Native Garbage Collection
  - Garbage Collection (GC) is a feature that allows memory management.  When a resource like a variable, is no longer used, GC will release the related resources back to the system.
